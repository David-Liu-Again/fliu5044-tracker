# üé∂ My Song History

This a simple web application for keeping track of what songs you have listened to.

## Setup
**Please make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on your machine before running this setup procedure.**

1. Clone this Github repository onto your local machine.
2. In your chosen terminal, navigate to the root directory of the local cloned repository.
3. Run  the command `npm i` in your terminal. This installs all necessary dependencies. 
4. Run  the command `npm run dev` in your terminal. This starts the web app itself. The URL of the web app should appear in your terminal (e.g. `localhost:1234`)
5. Open up any browser and copy-paste the URL from your terminal into the search bar. Then hit enter.
6. The web app should load. Now you can add songs to your heart's content. Wow. 

## Screen Configurations
The web app is responsive and should work with most desktop and mobile resolutions. During development the following two resolutions were used for testing:
+ Desktop Monitor **(1920px x 1080px)**
+ Samsung Galaxy S8+ **(360px x 740px)**

## Future Improvements
Currently, the functionality of *My Song History* is very basic. The typical user journey for this app is as follows:
1. The user listens to a song they like on a streaming platform, the radio, or elsewhere.
2. They open up the app and click the bottom-right button to add a song.
3. They manually fill in the form with details related to their song. If they don't know what data to enter (e.g. they don't know what year a song was released), they might make it up or search online for the correct data.
4. The user submits the form and the song is added to the list view.
5. Overtime, the user builds up a list of songs they like, by adding and deleting songs when they feel like it.

Some users might find that the app has utility, in that it is a convenient place to learn about and listen to their favourite music. However, during development, I came up with several ideas on how to improve and expand its functionality. Here are a few:


### üîçFilter and Sort Functions
![filter and search functions](https://github.com/David-Liu-Again/fliu5044-tracker/assets/128761089/08fe670a-e31d-499e-b878-dd1f693b9f08)

The inital design for *My Song History* included a search bar, placed above the list of added songs. Users could enter an artist name, genre, year of release or mood and the list below would automatically filter for any songs matching the user input, as the user types. Left of the search bar was a dropdown and toggle button, to allow users to sort the order of the songs in the list below. They could sort songs by artist name, year of release, song title or date added by selecting an option on the dropdown. The toggle button would reverse the song order when clicked.

This functionality is found in most search engines and music streaming websites. It's likely that users would expect something like this, so it would be beneficial to add it in future iterations.

###  üîÑ Auto-save and "Reset" button for Form
Currently the form resets itself when the user closes it. It would be better if the form automatically saved the user's input as they entered it, even if they closed the form or the browser tab. Then the user would not have to type in the details of their song all over again. To complement this, a "reset" button could be placed near the top of the form. When clicked, it could clear all the user input from the form. this would be useful if, halfway through filling out the form, a user decided that they no longer wanted to add a song.

### üîÆAutofill for Form

As a user types in the title of a song, the web app would present the names of existing songs under the textbox, using an API linked to some music-related database. This would function like the suggestions on Google or most popular search engines. Clicking on a suggested song would auto-fill most of the form fields (e.g. year of release, genre), based on API data. This would make the form-filling process much more efficient.

### üìù Edit Existing Songs
Allowing the users to change the details of existing songs after they have been added to the app would be highly beneficial. Users could use the feature to fix typos and factually incorrect data, or add/remove moods to the song, as their interpretation of the music changes.
