# ðŸŽ¶ My Song History

This a simple web application for keeping track of what songs you have listened to.

## Setup
**Please make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on your machine before running this setup procedure.**

1. clone this Github repository onto your local machine.
2. In your chosen terminal, navigate to the root directory of the local cloned repository.
3. Run  the command `npm i` in your terminal. This installs all necessary dependencies. 
4. Run  the command `npm run dev` in your terminal. This starts the web app itself. The URL of the web app should appear in your terminal (e.g. `localhost:1234`)
5. Open up any browser and copy-paste the URL from your terminal into the search bar. Then hit enter.
6. The web app should load. Now you can add songs to your heart's content. Wow. 

## Screen Configurations
The web app is responsive and should work with most desktop and mobile resolutions. During development the following two resolutions were used for testing:
+ Desktop Monitor **(1920px x 1080px)**
+ Samsung Galaxy S8+ **(360px x 740px)**
